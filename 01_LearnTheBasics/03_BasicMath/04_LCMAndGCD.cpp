/*
The Euclidean algorithm is an efficient method for computing the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers. The GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. The algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference.

Steps of the Euclidean Algorithm:
Divide and Find Remainder: Given two numbers, A and B, where A >= B, divide A by B and find the remainder R.

                                                  A=BÃ—Q+R

Here, Q is the quotient and R is the remainder.

Replace and Repeat: Replace A with B and B with R, and repeat the process until the remainder R is 0.

GCD Found: When the remainder R becomes 0, the current value of B (from the previous step) is the GCD of the original two numbers A and B.
