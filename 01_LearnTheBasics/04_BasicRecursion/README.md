# Recursion

It is a phenomenon when a function calls itself indefinitely until a specified condition is fulfilled.  

## What is Stack Overflow in Recursion?
Whenever recursion calls are executed, theyâ€™re simultaneously stored in a recursion stack where they wait for the completion of the recursive function. A recursive function can only be completed if a base condition is fulfilled and the control returns to the parent function. 

But, when there is no base condition given for a particular recursive function, it gets called indefinitely which results in a Stack Overflow i.e, exceeding the memory limit of the recursion stack and hence the program terminates giving a Segmentation Fault error. 

## Base Condition

It is the condition that is written in a recursive function in order for it to get completed and not to run infinitely. After encountering the base condition, the function terminates and returns back to its parent function simultaneously.
