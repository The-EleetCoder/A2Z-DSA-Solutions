Intuition (initial approach):

üëâ Understanding the Problem:
The goal is to find the longest consecutive sequence of integers in the array. For example, in the array [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2], the longest consecutive sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4].

üëâ Sorting for Simplification:
By sorting the array, consecutive elements naturally appear next to each other. This allows us to traverse the array once to count the length of consecutive sequences.

üëâ Two-Pointer Technique:
1. Pointers:
We use two pointers, p1 and p2, to traverse the array. p1 points to the start of the current sequence, and p2 moves forward to find the next element in the sequence.

2. Consecutive Elements:
If the difference between nums[p2] and nums[p1] is 1, the elements are consecutive, so we increase the current_length.

3. Handling Duplicates:
If the difference is 0, it means there are duplicate elements, so we move both pointers forward without altering the sequence length.

4. Breaking the Sequence:
If the difference is greater than 1, it means the sequence is broken. We then update the max_length and reset the current_length to 1.

5. Final Check:
After the loop, we perform one final check to ensure that the last sequence is considered when determining the maximum sequence length.

üëâ Efficiency:
Time Complexity: o(ùëõlog‚Å°ùëõ) due to sorting the array.
Space Complexity: O(1) if we don't consider the space used by the sorting algorithm.

/*
Optimal Approach Intuition:

Using a Hash Set for O(1) Lookups:
We store all the elements in a hash set to facilitate quick lookups. This allows us to efficiently determine whether a number exists in the set.

Identifying Sequence Starts:
For each element in the array, we check whether it is the start of a sequence. This is done by verifying if num - 1 exists in the set. If it doesn‚Äôt, the current number (num) is the start of a sequence.

Counting the Length of the Sequence:
Once we identify the start of a sequence, we continue checking for the next consecutive numbers (num + 1, num + 2, etc.) until the sequence is broken.
We keep track of the length of this sequence and update the max_length if this sequence is the longest we've found so far.

Efficiency:
Time Complexity: O(n) because each number is processed at most twice (once when checking if it is the start of a sequence and once when extending the sequence).
Space Complexity: O(n) for storing the elements in the hash set.
